============

Brief
Create a simple list application

Functionality
• A user inputs an item into the text field, which is then added to the list on clicking ‘Add’.
• A user can delete an item from the list by clicking ‘Delete’.
• The count updates depending on how many items are in the list.

Constraints
• Use observer pattern.
• Counting of DOM elements to find out the number of items in the list isn’t acceptable. Information relating to the current list should be stored in a JS object or local storage, for example.
• Browser support is latest Chrome or Firefox.
• Use native JS.
• No MVC libraries to be used (e.g. backbone, knockout)
• Replication of exact design isn’t necessary.
• CSS and JavaScript must be external files.
